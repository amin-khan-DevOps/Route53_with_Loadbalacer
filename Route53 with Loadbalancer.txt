
                                                         // ROUTE-53 LOADBALANCER //
Steps :

1. Create VPC

↪  vpc and more.
   ex:-Load 53
↪Two Availability zones
↪Number of public subnets is 2.
↪Number of private Subnet is 0.
↪No Need of NAT Gateways.
↪None vpc endpoints.
                 ↓
2. Create instances

Instance 1- 53load & → Select ( 53load-vpc) →
Subnet-Public1 → Security group (port no: 22,80,443)

Instance 2 - 53 Load 2 → select ( 53 load-vpc) → Subnet-public2
 Security - group (port no :22, 80,443).

3. Target Groups
→Instances
→53load TG
↪HTTP > 80
↪53 Lood-vpc Select
→ Select two instances & click
include as pending below
→ Create Target group
→ Now Need To Make TG Healthy 
→ TG can be healthy if we connect both the instances and install httpd and host the web pages.

                                               ↓       

↪ Connect Instance I to ssh
ex:- (53 Load 1) connect ssh
→ yum update
→ yum install httpd -y
→ cd /var/www/html/
  copy the link of CSS template and download in html directory by,
→ wget <Link of the CSS template>
[..html]→ .zip file their present
[..html]→unzip <file name> 
[..html] ls
example the file present their name 'troweld-html'
[..html]# cd troweld-html
[..troweld-html]# ls
All files will show here.
→Move all that files in /html directory just before this directory.
→[troweld-html]# mv * ../
→[..html]# ls
All files comes in html directory.
→[..html]# systemctl start httpd
                   systemctl status httpd
copy public IP and Paste in URL and Enter
*Imp*: same Do with instance 2 by hosting different web page.

Now you have to wait for
time  to see TG Healthy But
don't wait start creating Load Balancer.
                 
                                               ↓       

4. Create Load Balancer.
→Select ALB
→internet-facing 
→ select VPC → 53load-vpc
→ Select Both eu-west-1a and eu-west-1b
→ Select only security groug consist 
of 80, 443, 22
↪Listeners main
HTTP →80→ <select TG ex: 53LoadTG> 
Note:
     Now Load Balancer Created
→ Go Load Balancer and Copy  DNS name
→ First check TG Must Healty.
→ copy DNS of load balancer and paste it in URL.
→ page refresh karke dekho jo do page host kiya gaya hai vo change hona chahiye tho LoadBalancer  work kar raha hai.

5.Now Go To Hostinger For.
→ click manager
→ go nameservers
→ click change nameserver.
Now copy the 4nameservers which provided by ROUTE53 and paste it in Hostinger.

6.GO ACM [amazon certificate manager]
→ create request
→ Next
→ Domain Name main vo domain daliye jo buy kiya hai.
→ ACM provide CNAME when you click it.

7. Go Route53
↪Go Hosted zones
 ↪create hosted zone
  Domain Name:
                and Create Hosted Zone.
→ Now click terraquad.cloud and go inside it.
→ Their will be option of create Record
  ↪click create record 
      ↪ON The Alias
endpoint→ Alias To Application and classic load balancer
Region→  Ireland
choose LoadBalancer → select Load Balancer

           Now Create Record
Also Copy all name server from Route53 and paste it in Hostinger Domain.


8.Now Go Load Balancer
→  Add Listners their 
  ↪select HTTPS To Port[443]
→Forward To TG
→select a Target group
→From ACM
→select a certificate of ACM and create it.

9. overviw of task
→Now Copy Domain Which we BUY and Paste it in URL.
→Now Webpage will see their with security SSL.
→when you Refresh the page two webpage will see after one.
→This is task Now it Finsih
